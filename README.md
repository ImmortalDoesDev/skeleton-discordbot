# skeleton-discordbot
It's the basic, skeletal structure for your discord bot! You can use this as basic code to create multiple commands!

So, you need to go to config.js and add the right information you need. Be sure to completely fill all the details.
Then, go to your terminal and type, 

`node index.js` and that could bring your bot live!
Type, `<your-prefix>ping`
